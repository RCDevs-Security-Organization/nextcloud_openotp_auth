### **********   DESCRIPTION   **********

OpenOTP plugin for Nextcloud enables multi-factor authentication on Admin and User portals.

Users' credentials can be validated: 
- Locally by Nextcloud (Nextcloud local accounts),
- Through an LDAP service (LDAP accounts)

Once the first step of the authentication is successfully validated, the authentication workflow continues through the OpenOTP Plugin for Nextcloud and OpenOTP server(s). 
The plugin will submit an authentication request to OpenOTP server(s) with the provided credentials during the first step (username).
In both scenarios (local and LDAP accounts), for the authentication to work with OpenOTP, the provided username must match a valid WebADM licensed account.

In order to use that plugin, you MUST HAVE OpenOTP Security Suite running in your infrastructure (on-premise or in the cloud).

## OpenOTP Authentication Server

OpenOTPâ„¢ is an enterprise-grade user authentication solution based on open standards.
OpenOTP is the most advanced authentication server for your Domain users. It supports the combination of single-factor and multi-factor authentication for user access with One-Time Password technologies (OTP), Mobile Push, FIDO2, Voice Biometrics, PKI and more.
It includes a set of integration plugins and bridges which cover near 100% of the enterprise needs.
OpenOTP is provided as an Enterprise product and a Cloud service, depending on your needs.
